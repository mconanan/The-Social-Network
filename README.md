# The-Social-Network
 a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

 'The Social Network' builds out the back-end of a social media interface using Model-Controller architecture with a MongoDB database via Mongoose. Since there is no front-end, all routes have been tested with insomnia.
